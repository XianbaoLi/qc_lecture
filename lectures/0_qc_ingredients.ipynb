In quantum computation, this unit is a quantum bit (qubit), which is a superposition of 0 and 1 ($|0\\rangle$ and $|1\\rangle$ in Dirac notation). We identify the two basis states with the vectors $\\binom{1}{0}$ and $\\binom{0}{1}$, respectively. A single qubit can be in any superposition\n",

Here for instance $|1\\rangle \\otimes|0\\rangle$ means that the first qubit is in its basis state $|1\\rangle$ and the second qubit is in its basis state $|0\\rangle$.
